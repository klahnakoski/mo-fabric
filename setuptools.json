    "long_description": "# mo-fabric\n\nA façade atop [fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)\n\n## Overview\n\nI have revisited [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) (September 2018) to find it can handle multiple threads and multiple connections. This makes all my automation faster!\n\nLike with most APIs, I made a façade because Fabric is not congruent to my own programming conventions. This is not bad, just different: The domain I work in is slightly different than what the Fabric developers expect. \n\nHere are the differences:\n\n* All `stdout` and `strerr` from the remote machine is annotated, and shunted, the the local logging module.\n* A few convenience methods are added:\n  * `conn.exists(path)` - to test if a remote file exists\n  * `with conn.warn_only():` - context manager if you do not care if your commands fail\n  * `get(remote, local)` - allows you to use tilde (`~`) on Windows to refer to home directory\n  * `put(local, remote, use_sudo=False)` - same as `get` plus the ability to upload as root\n  * `sudo(command)` works with the `cd()` context manager\n* Added `Result.__contains__()` so checking for patterns in command output is simpler\n",
